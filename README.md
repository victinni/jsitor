    <h1>The Evolution of the Bicycle</h1>
<div>1. In 1817 Baron von Drais invented a walking machine that would help him get around the royal gardens faster.</div>
<div>2. The device know as the Draisienne (or "hobby horse") was made of wood, and propelled by pushing your feet on the ground in a gliding movement.</div>
<div>3. It was not seen as suitable for any place other than a well maintained pathway. </div>
<div>4. In 1865, the velocipede (meaning "fast foot") attached pedals to the front wheel, but its wooden structure made it extremely uncomfortable.</div>
<div>5. In 1870 the first all-metal machine appeared. The pedals were attached directly to the front wheel.
<p>6 Solid rubber tires and the long spokes of the large front wheel provided a much smoother ride than its predecessor.</div>
